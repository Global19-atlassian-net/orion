	<b><a href="http://eclipse.org/orion/">The Orion Project</a></b>
	Orion is an open-source development platform focused on creating applications for the web, in the web.

	The vision behind Orion is to move software development to the web by 
	enabling open tool integration through HTTP and REST, JSON, OAuth, OpenID, and others. 
	We exploit internet design principles throughout, allowing Orion to be easily run in the browser, locally and in Electron. 

	Great care has been taken to provide a world class web development experience, rather than to recreate the traditional desktop
	IDE experience in a browser tab.

	Please refer to our <a href ="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.orion">project page</a> for plan and overall project information, or
	head over to the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion">wiki</a> for even more information about Orion.

	Orion's objective is to create a browser-based open tool integration 
	platform which is entirely focused on developing for the web, in the web. 
	Tools are written in JavaScript and run in the browser. Great care has been 
	taken to provide a web experience for development, rather than to recreate the 
	traditional desktop IDE experience in a browser tab.
