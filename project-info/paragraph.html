<p><b><a href="http://eclipse.org/orion/">The Orion Project</a></b> 
Orion's objective is to create a browser-based open tool integration 
platform which is entirely focused on developing for the web, in the web. 
Tools are written in JavaScript and run in the browser. Great care has been 
taken to provide a web experience for development, rather than to recreate the 
traditional desktop IDE experience in a browser tab.
