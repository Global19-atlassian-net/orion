# Orion
A minimal, single-user deployment of [Eclipse Orion](http://www.eclipse.org/orion/). Orion provides an extensible IDE that runs in your browser. It's particularly good for writing Javascript.

This repository is solely for the Orion website (hosted at [https://orionhub.org orionhub.org]). For full instructions on working with Orion and the source code, see the [Getting Started guide](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Node/Getting_started).

## Contributing

Orion source code is available in four separate GitHub repositories. For complete details on getting the source and getting setup to develop Orion, see the [Orion wiki](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Getting_the_source) and the [contributing code wiki](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Contributing_Code).

Bug reports are welcome in [bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Orion).

Fixes are welcome as patches on bug reports or as pull requests directly against any one of the repositories.
